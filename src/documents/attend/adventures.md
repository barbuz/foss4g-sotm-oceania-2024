# Tasmanian Adventures

This page is an opinionated list of things to do while you're in Tasmania. We'll start small
and end with some longer adventures.

## Less than a day

### MONA

Go to [MONA](https://mona.net.au/visit). This is pretty much required. You'll need
around half a day and if you can spare the money, take the return ferry from
Salamanca. Get lunch out there, explore the museum, pay extra for little side
adventures and get lost in the tunnels or laze about on the lawn. There's 
usually Jazz on a Saturday afternoon.

### Mount Wellington

You can drive to the top and catch some fantastic views, but take a jumper as it's
always cold. About halfway up is called the Springs, and there are a whole bunch
of [short and long walks](https://tastrails.com/category/location/hobart-and-surrounding/wellington-park/)
from here. There are tourist buses and bike hiring things, but you can just catch
a ride with someone and explore too.
